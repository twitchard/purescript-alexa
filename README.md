This library contains incomplete type definitions for version 1.0 of the request and response JSON types of the [Alexa Skills API](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html).

Notably, it lacks definitions for the AudioPlayer and PlaybackController request types. However, it should be enough to get you started making a basic skill with Alexa.

Contributions are welcome!
